# Coding Art Repository

## Why this exists

In 1998, while learning to code, I kept circling the same question: is there art in code?

Programming is sold as precision. Deterministic. Exact. A machine that rewards correctness and punishes ambiguity. And yet, inside that strictness, something keeps leaking through: style, rhythm, intent, taste, obsession, humor, rebellion. A fingerprint.

This repository is a long running attempt to study that contradiction and keep pushing it until it becomes visible.

## What this repository is

A collection of coding artworks: small programs, interactive pieces, visual experiments, and "unsafe" ideas used on purpose. Some are readable, some are hostile, some are quiet. Many are designed to be experienced, not just inspected.

Each piece is an argument written in syntax.

## The philosophy

Code is deterministic, but the reasons we write it are not.  
Code is exact, but the choices inside it are full of aesthetics.  
Constraints do not eliminate expression, they sharpen it.

This repo exists to question the boundary between:
- function and meaning
- correctness and beauty
- tool and medium
- program and performance

## Safety note

Some works in this repository may contain techniques that are intentionally provocative, like dynamic evaluation, self modification, or format bending (for example, scripts embedded in SVG).

Treat these pieces like you would treat any executable artifact:
- read before running
- run locally when possible
- do not open files with embedded scripts unless you trust the source and understand the code

Risk is part of the medium, but responsibility is part of the practice.

## How to experience the pieces

- Start in the folders and open the "README" inside each artwork.
- Most pieces are meant to be opened in a browser.
- Some include a "safe" version and a "danger" version, as an explicit part of the concept.

## Contributing

This is primarily a personal archive, but conversation is welcome. If you have an idea, a critique, or a reference that bends the same boundary, open an issue.
